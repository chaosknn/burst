burst 
database application common framework for java 

half your work,half your bugs 
for oracle,db2,sql server,mysql application
use TblDesigner?.xls to design tables,
then run vba to create models and tables' java class;
copy these class to sample project 

and then,you can use these functions now: 
1:table create,drop 
2:data create,update,read,delete 
3:query by one table or multi tables; kinds of field match types(equals,like,between......);order by multi fields;controlled by pages 

you need to know very little about these databases 
you need to write nothing about sql 
you need to write no one model class 

just focus on your business!!
